# customer-frontend

### Assumptions
* api calls will be secured with a token, generated by a SSO service that redirects back to our app with a query parameter containing the token 

### Thoughts
* I use any UI library because I don't know the target UI library
* To achieve better testability, the components must be cut better
  * one test example is added, for production more tests should be added
* In this task the focus lies on the example functionality, accessibility and design will be discussed in the team and implemented accordingly
  * e.g. a menu is missing
